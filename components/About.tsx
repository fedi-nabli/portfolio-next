          I'm Sonny. 💯 You might also know me as PAPA React! I'll be your coach
          & mentor inside the PAPAFAM, here's a little bit about me... I've been
          coding for over 10 years now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked
          both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their
          companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in helping
          others excel and persue their dreams as upcoming developers. 🌟 With
          this passion, I have now trained thousand's of developers across the
          globe. Through live coaching sessions on YouTube, I have accumulated
          deveral MILLLIONS views demonstarting how to apply developer skills in a
          range of cool builds and challenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching
          REAL WORLD projects to help students enter the world of web development.
          You'll get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to
          succeed in real-world in this community. And if that's not enough, I have
          cloned most of the applications you have used in your life!
